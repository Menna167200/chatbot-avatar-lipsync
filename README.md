## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Real-time Lipsync:** Avatar powered by Unity + SALSA Suite.
- **AI Chatbot:** Text & voice input supported.
- **Voice Pipeline:**
  - **Speech-to-Text:** Whisper Large v3
  - **LLM Chatbot:** Mistral Nemo (OpenRouter)
  - **Text-to-Speech:** `tts_models/en/vctk/vits`
- **Backend:** FastAPI running on Kaggle and exposed via **LocalTunnel**.
- **Frontend:** React page.
- **Audio Fetch System:** A **custom Unity C# script** automatically fetches the latest audio response from **backend**.

## üìå How It Works
1. User speaks or types a message.
2. LangGraph processes the input and generates a chatbot response.
3. Response is converted to speech (TTS).
4. Unity Avatar fetches the audio file and performs lipsync using SALSA Suite.

## üôè Acknowledgements & Inspiration
This project was inspired by the incredible work of [Wassim SAMAD](https://github.com/wass08).  
His projects and ideas on 3d avatars motivated me to build my own chatbot with a 3D avatar and lipsync.

## üí° Final Note
This project was built entirely using **open-source models** and **free servers** (Kaggle for GPU, LocalTunnel for exposure).  
I hope this demonstrates that you can build high-quality, innovative projects **without spending a lot of money**‚Äîjust with creativity, persistence, and open tools.
